# Final Project

The increasing complexity of electricity markets, driven by the integration of renewable energy sources, fluctuating fuel prices, and changing weather conditions, highlights the need for accurate data analysis and rediction. Effective forecasting and pattern identification are crucial for market participants to optimize operations and make informed decisions. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to address these challenges in the Spanish electricity market using historical data from the ESIOS platform provided by Red Eléctrica de España (REE).

The project focuses on three main tasks: supervised learning to predict day-ahead electricity prices, unsupervised learning to cluster daily price profiles and identify patterns, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These methodologies provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and forecasting market dynamics.

Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to ensure the dataset was clean, visualized, and ready for modelling. The supervised learning model was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R², while clustering methods like Kmeans and hierarchical clustering revealed significant patterns in price behaviours. PCA was applied to reduce data complexity and assess its impact on model performance, enhancing computational efficiency.

This report synthesizes these methodologies to offer a structured framework for applying machine learning to electricity market data. The findings contribute to the growing discourse on utilizing data science to improve energy system operations and support decision-making in an evolving market landscape.
